# My Claude Code Configuration (Example Repository)

**This is my personal Claude Code configuration that I maintain in Git.** I'm sharing it publicly as an example of how to organize and version-control a Claude Code setup. This system works for me and my needs, but might not work for others. My requirements are:

1. **Make components available globally** - Have my slash commands, agents, hooks, etc. accessible across all projects I work on
2. **Source control everything** - Version control these components for history, backup, and evolution tracking
3. **Multi-machine sync** - Use the same setup on multiple machines and systems seamlessly
4. **Learn by doing** - Continue learning about agentic systems by experimenting with different patterns
5. **Share and improve** - Document my approach for others and gather feedback to improve

> **What this is:** My personal collection of agents, slash commands, and tools that I use across all my projects.
> 
> **What this isn't:** A framework or product to install. It's one person's configuration shared as a reference.

## Why I'm Sharing This

Claude Code supports personal configurations via `~/.claude/`, but there aren't many examples of how to organize and maintain them. This repository shows:

- **How I structure my configuration** for maintainability
- **How I use Git** to version control and sync across machines
- **Examples of agents, slash commands, and hooks** I've found useful
- **Patterns for organizing** a growing collection of Claude customizations

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Install as Plugin (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this configuration is via Claude Code's plugin system.

**Quick Install:**

1. In Claude Code, type `/plugin` and select "Add marketplace"
2. Enter: `https://github.com/lpasqualis/lpclaude`
3. Type `/plugin` again and select "Install plugin"
4. Choose `lpclaude-config` from the list
5. Restart Claude Code

**Or use commands directly:**
```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace (HTTPS format recommended)
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/lpasqualis/lpclaude

# Step 2: Install the plugin
/plugin install lpclaude-config
```

**Or skip the marketplace and install directly:**
```bash
/plugin install https://github.com/lpasqualis/lpclaude
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One-command installation
- ✅ Automatic updates via plugin system
- ✅ Easy to enable/disable without uninstalling
- ✅ No manual symlink management
- ✅ Works alongside your personal `~/.claude/` configs

See [PLUGIN_INSTALL.md](PLUGIN_INSTALL.md) for detailed plugin documentation.

### Option 2: Traditional Setup (Manual Control)

For full control over files and symlinks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lpasqualis/lpclaude.git ~/.lpclaude
cd ~/.lpclaude
./setup.sh
```

See ["If You Want to Try My Components"](#if-you-want-to-try-my-components) section below for details.

### Option 3: Browse and Learn

**Not ready to install?** You can also:

#### As a Reference
Browse the repository to:
- See how to structure your own Claude configuration
- Get ideas for agents and slash commands you might want to create
- Learn the syntax and patterns for different component types
- Understand how various Claude Code features work together

#### Copy Individual Components
If you find something useful:
1. Copy the specific file to your own `~/.claude/` directory
2. Customize it for your needs
3. Make it yours - don't just use my configuration as-is

#### Fork as a Starting Point
To create your own configuration repository:
1. Fork this repo
2. Delete my specific configurations
3. Add your own agents, slash commands, and preferences
4. Maintain your own version-controlled Claude setup

## What's in My Configuration

Here's what I've built for my workflow (yours will be different):

- **Slash Commands** (30+) - My shortcuts for git, documentation, job processing, learning capture, VS Code theming
- **Agents** - Auto-triggering helpers I use for security reviews, documentation, task queueing
- **Workers** - My custom pattern: reusable task templates that slash commands can run in parallel (not a Claude feature)
- **Hooks** - Shell scripts that prevent me from making mistakes (like cd'ing to wrong directories)
- **Output Styles** - How I prefer Claude to format responses for different contexts
- **Status Line** - My terminal prompt integration showing session context
- **Utility Scripts** - Helper tools like my `addjob` task queuing system
- **Directives** - General directives split into numbered files, compiled into CLAUDE.md (see [Directives Compilation](#directives-compilation) below)
- **Resources** - Research and documentation I've collected about Claude Code patterns
- **Organization** - How I structure everything to stay maintainable

> **New to Claude Code?** Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI that brings Claude's AI capabilities directly to your terminal. It natively supports personal configurations via `~/.claude/` - this repository is just one example of how to use that feature.

## Prerequisites

Before installing this configuration, you'll need:

### 1. Claude Code Installed
Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI for AI-powered coding assistance.
- **Installation Guide**: [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
- **Quick Check**: Run `claude --version` in your terminal

### 2. Understanding ~/.claude Directory
- This is Claude Code's built-in location for "personal" configurations and tools
- It applies to all projects you work on your machine
- This repository uses symlinks to replace specific folders (agents, commands, etc.)
- Non sym-linked parts of your .claude configuration remain untouched
- This separation ensures the repo can be updated without affecting the rest of your personal configurations

### 3. System Requirements
- **OS**: macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL
- **Tools**: Git and basic terminal familiarity
- **Space**: ~10MB for the configuration files
- **Optional**: VS Code for visual editing (any text editor works)

> **First time using Claude Code?** Start with the Quick Try section below to test individual components before full installation.

## LSP Commands

### `/lsp:setup`

Configures LSP plugins at project scope. Run it once when starting work in a new project:

```
/lsp:setup
```

It reads your installed LSP plugins, scans the project for language indicators, then asks
which plugins to enable. Detected languages are listed first, but you can enable any
installed plugin regardless of whether matching files exist yet. Your selections are written
to `.claude/settings.json` in the project root.

## Usage

- **Agents** activate automatically based on keywords in your conversation with Claude
- **Slash commands** are typed directly in Claude Code (e.g., `/git:commit-and-push`)
- **addjob** (shell utility) queues tasks from your terminal, then `/jobs:do` (slash command) executes them in parallel in Claude

## How It Works

If you choose to use the standard setup (you don't have to), this repository uses **selective symbolic links** to integrate with Claude Code's configuration system:

```
~/.claude/                         This Repository (symlinked folders)
├── agents/ ───────→           ~/.lpclaude/agents/

├── CLAUDE.md ─────→           ~/.lpclaude/directives/CLAUDE_global_directives.md
│
├── [Your personal files remain here, untouched]
├── memory/                    (Your personal memory files)
├── .claude.json               (Your personal project settings)
└── [Other personal configs]   (Any other personal configurations)
```

**Important: Symlinks Replace Entire Folders**: When you use symlinks (via setup.sh), each symlinked folder completely replaces that folder in `~/.claude/`. For example, symlinking `agents/` means ALL agents come from this repo - you can't mix repo agents with your own agents in that folder.

**If you want to pick and choose specific components**:
- Don't use the symlink setup
- Instead, manually copy individual files you want from this repo to your `~/.claude/` folders
- This lets you combine components from this repo with your own custom components

**Benefits of the symlink approach**:
- Keep the repository cleanly separated from your personal configurations
- Allow your `~/.claude/` to evolve with your personal settings, memory files, and project-specific configs
- Enable easy updates to the shared components without touching your personal data
- Make uninstallation simple - just remove the symlinks, your personal config remains

                  └──────────────────┘

How Components Work:
• DIRECTIVES: Define behavior and standards for all interactions
• AGENTS: Auto-trigger on keywords (e.g., "security" → hack-spotter)
• SLASH COMMANDS: User types /command (e.g., /git:commit-and-push)
• HOOKS: Run at specific events (e.g., before shell commands)
• WORKERS*: My custom pattern - reusable task templates for parallel execution
• OUTPUT STYLES: Format Claude's responses (not shown)

*Note: Workers are not a Claude Code feature - they're my pattern for organizing
reusable task instructions that slash commands can execute in parallel via the Task tool,
without the overhead of creating full agents that consume context space.
```

## If You Want to Try My Components

### Option 1: Copy Individual Pieces (Recommended)
**Browse and copy only what's useful to you.**

Cherry-pick specific components:

```bash
# First, clone the repo (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/lpasqualis/lpclaude.git ~/.lpclaude

# Create directories as needed
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents ~/.claude/commands/git

# Copy only the components you want
cp ~/.lpclaude/agents/hack-spotter.md ~/.claude/agents/
cp ~/.lpclaude/commands/git/commit-and-push.md ~/.claude/commands/git/
cp ~/.lpclaude/hooks/guard-cd.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
```

**Benefits of selective installation:**
- Mix components from this repo with your own custom agents/slash commands
- Keep some folders under your control while using others from this repo
- Test individual components before committing to the full set

**Drawbacks:**
- Manual updates - you'll need to copy files again when the repo updates
- Potential dependency issues if components rely on each other
- No automatic compilation of directives


### Option 2: Use My Entire Setup (Not Recommended)

**Only do this if you really want MY exact configuration.** This is how I set up my own machines, but you probably want your own configuration, not mine.


```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lpasqualis/lpclaude.git ~/.lpclaude
cd ~/.lpclaude

# Run setup (creates symlinks and installs optional dependencies)
./setup.sh
```

#### What setup.sh Does:
1. **Attempts to create symbolic links** in `~/.claude/` pointing to this repository:
   - **Claude-standard folders** (recognized by Claude Code):
     - `agents/` - Auto-triggering AI agents
     - `commands/` - Slash commands
     - `output-styles/` - Response formatting styles
     - `hooks/` - Event-triggered shell scripts
     - `CLAUDE.md` - Shared memory file
   - **Supporting folders**:
     - `directives/` - Compiled preferences and standards
     - `resources/` - Reference documents and guides
     - `utils/` - Helper scripts (like addjob)
     - `workers/` - Parallel processing templates
     - `mcp/` - Model Context Protocol servers
   - **Configuration files**:
     - `settings.json` - Claude Code settings
     - `statusline.sh` - Terminal prompt integration
   - **Only creates symlinks if the target doesn't exist**
   - **If folders/files already exist**: Skips them entirely (your content is preserved)
   - Everything else in `~/.claude/` remains completely untouched
2. **Installs optional dependencies** (if not present):
   - `brew` - Package manager (macOS only)
   - `jq` - JSON processor used by some commands
   - `llm` - Tool for delegating to external LLMs
   - Modern terminal fonts for better display
3. **Compiles directives** into a single CLAUDE.md file
4. **Validates installation** and reports any issues

#### Important: Handling Existing Folders
- **If you have existing `agents/` or `commands/` folders**: The setup will skip them and warn you
- **To use this repo with existing folders**, you have three options:
  1. Backup and move your existing folders: `mv ~/.claude/agents ~/.claude/agents.backup`
  2. Use selective installation (Option 1 above) to manually copy specific files
  3. Merge your content into this repo and fork it


### Optional: Make addjob Available System-Wide

To use the `addjob` utility from any directory, add an alias to your shell configuration:

**For zsh (default on modern macOS):**
```bash
echo "alias addjob='python3 ~/.claude/utils/addjob'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**For bash:**
```bash
echo "alias addjob='python3 ~/.claude/utils/addjob'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**For fish:**
```bash
echo "alias addjob='python3 ~/.claude/utils/addjob'" >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

## Session Context & Memory Management

Claude Code sessions have limited context windows, so I've developed patterns to manage both memory and context effectively:

### Context Management Strategies
- **CLAUDE.md** - Persistent directives loaded at session start (doesn't consume conversation context)
- **Agents vs Workers** - Agents consume context even when idle; workers are loaded only when needed
- **Selective Tool Usage** - Some slash commands delegate to the Task tool to avoid loading everything into main context
- **Job Queuing** - The `addjob` system defers work to future sessions, preserving context for current tasks

### Memory Persistence
- **Global Memory** - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` persists across all projects and sessions
- **Project Memory** - `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in projects adds project-specific context
- **Session Capture** - Slash commands like `/docs:capture-session` preserve session knowledge for handoffs
- **Learning Extraction** - `/learn` slash command extracts insights from conversations into permanent memory

### Why This Matters
Context is precious in AI systems. By managing it carefully, I can:
- Work on larger, more complex tasks without hitting limits
- Maintain consistent behavior across sessions
- Build up institutional knowledge over time
- Hand off work between sessions or team members effectively

## Directives Compilation

I organize my Claude directives (coding standards, behavioral guidelines, technical patterns) using a compilation system that might be unnecessary with Claude's newer @-mention feature.

### How My Directives System Works

1. **Numbered directive files** in `directives/`:
   - `0010_core_principles.md` - Core behavioral guidelines
   - `0020_prompt_engineering.md` - AI prompt best practices  
   - `0030_engineering_strategies.md` - Technical patterns
   - Files are numbered to control compilation order

2. **Compilation via `rebuild_claude_md.sh`**:
   ```bash
   ./rebuild_claude_md.sh
   ```
   - Concatenates all `.md` files in `directives/` folder
   - Processes them in alphabetical order (hence the numbering)
   - Creates `directives/CLAUDE_global_directives.md`
   - This compiled file is symlinked as `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

3. **Why this approach?**
   - Keeps different directive categories organized in separate files
   - Makes it easy to enable/disable specific directives (rename to `.disabled`)
   - Version control tracks changes to individual directive categories
   - Compilation creates a single file that Claude reads at startup

### Note About Claude's @-Mention Feature

**Claude Code now supports @-mentioning files directly**, which might make this compilation approach unnecessary. You could potentially:
- Keep directives in separate files
- @-mention specific directive files when needed
- Avoid the compilation step entirely

I'm still investigating whether @-mentions fully replace the need for a compiled CLAUDE.md. For now, my compilation system works reliably.

## Creating Your Own Configuration Repository

**Want to create your own version-controlled Claude configuration?** Here's how I organize mine:

### Starting Your Own

1. **Create Your Repository**
   ```bash
   # Start fresh with your own structure
   mkdir ~/my-claude-config
   cd ~/my-claude-config
   git init
   
   # Create the folders you need
   mkdir agents commands hooks output-styles directives utils
   ```

2. **Build Your Components**
   - Start with one or two agents/slash commands you'll actually use
   - Test them by copying to `~/.claude/` first
   - Once they work, commit them to your repo
   - Gradually build up your collection

3. **How I Sync Across Machines**
   - I use symlinks from `~/.claude/` to my repo
   - When I update the repo on one machine, I pull on others
   - This keeps all my machines consistent
   - You might prefer a different approach

4. **Ideas for Your Configuration**
   - **Automate what you do repeatedly** - That's what slash commands are for
   - **Create agents for your review process** - Code review, security, docs
   - **Add hooks for your common mistakes** - Prevent errors before they happen
   - **Build your own directives** - Your coding standards, not mine

### Best Practices for Your Configuration

- **Start Small**: Begin with 2-3 agents and slash commands, grow organically
- **Document Everything**: Each component should explain its purpose
- **Version Control**: Commit your customizations for team sharing
- **Test First**: Verify components work before team-wide deployment
